/// This trait is used when constructing an instance of `Framed` or
/// `FramedRead`. An implementation of `Decoder` takes a byte stream that has
/// already been buffered in `src` and decodes the data into a stream of
/// `Self::Item` frames.
///
/// Implementations are able to track state on `self`, which enables
/// implementing stateful streaming parsers. In many cases, though, this type
/// will simply be a unit struct (e.g. `struct HttpDecoder`).

    ///
    /// This method is called by `FramedRead` whenever bytes are ready to be
    /// parsed.  The provided buffer of bytes is what's been read so far, and
    /// this instance of `Decode` can determine whether an entire frame is in
    /// the buffer and is ready to be returned.
    ///
    /// If an entire frame is available, then this instance will remove those
    /// bytes from the buffer provided and return them as a decoded
    /// frame. Note that removing bytes from the provided buffer doesn't always
    /// necessarily copy the bytes, so this should be an efficient operation in
    /// most circumstances.
    ///
    /// If the bytes look valid, but a frame isn't fully available yet, then
    /// `Ok(None)` is returned. This indicates to the `Framed` instance that
    /// it needs to read some more bytes before calling this method again.
    ///
    /// Note that the bytes provided may be empty. If a previous call to
    /// `decode` consumed all the bytes in the buffer then `decode` will be
    /// called again until it returns `None`, indicating that more bytes need to
    /// be read.

    /// Finally, if the bytes in the buffer are malformed then an error is
    /// returned indicating why. This informs `Framed` that the stream is now
